Movie Recommendation with Market Basket Analysis

In this project, we utilized a data mining algorithm, Apriori, to mine a relationship among films and build a movie recommendation engine. Apriori is a technique in Market Basket Analysis used to discover items that are usually bought together. Frequently purchased itemset suggests marketing opportunity when customers displayed interest in a subset item. In this case, movies can be view as a set of items. Our aim is to recommend a movie that can pique user’s interest based on their certain preference. We obtained our training data from MovieLens’s website(http://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/). We used MovieLens 20M Dataset dataset which consisted 20,000,263 user ratings, across 27,278 movies and 138,493 raters. We found that the mining technique can be utilized to uncover a relationship in the movies that are frequently watched together.
